# WeatherTracker

## Description
I am not quite done with this yet, but the search bar functions and searches for a city. Right now the bootstrap cards overwrite each other, but they still pull the relevant data. I am currently working on a way to make all the cards show independently. The code functions, but it is not pretty. I am hoping to further style it to make it look nicer.

## Sources
I pulled inspiration from WUSTL 
The weather API came from the OpenWeatherMap website: https://openweathermap.org/api
